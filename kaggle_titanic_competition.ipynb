    "- Age has an effect on survivability (due to)\n",
    "- The cabin has an effect on survivability (due to proximity to exits, etc.)\n",

    "Please note that these assumptions are completely made up and based on intuition. They are just there to give me something to work with and investigate. Even if there is a relationship between survivability and the feature, this does not necessarily mean that there is a correlation or proof of my initial assumption."
